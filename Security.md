# Security Design

## 🔒 SharePoint Controls

- Private SharePoint site
- Restricted HR access
- Library-level permissions
- Year-based segregation

---

## 🔗 Sharing Configuration

Recommended:
- View Only
- People in your organization

More Secure Option:
- Specific people only

Not Recommended:
- Anyone with link

---

## 📂 Access Isolation

Each employee folder:
T4 Slips/<Year>/<Employee Folder>


Only link-based access is distributed.

---

## 📜 Audit & Compliance

- SharePoint audit logging
- No email attachments
- Controlled access via M365 authentication
- CRA retention compliance supported

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

Eliminates:
- Manual attachment errors
- Wrong-recipient risk
- Public link exposure
- Untracked document sharing
